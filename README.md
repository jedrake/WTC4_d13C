I recommend that you clone this repository into an Rstudio project by copying the SSH (or HTTPS) link on the right, and pasting the link into a new Rstudio project URL (File > New Project > Version Control > Git). You will also need git. This process is described in useful detail here: http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/ . Email John if you're having an issue and he will do his best to sort you out (je.drake AT westernsydney.edu.au).
